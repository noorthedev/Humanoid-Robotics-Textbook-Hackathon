# Development Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Feature Branch**: `1-textbook-spec`
**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Plan**: [specs/1-textbook-spec/plan.md](specs/1-textbook-spec/plan.md)
**Spec**: [specs/1-textbook-spec/spec.md](specs/1-textbook-spec/spec.md)

## Summary

This document outlines the executable tasks for building the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook in Docusaurus, organized into phases corresponding to setup, foundational elements, individual user stories (lessons), and final polish/verification. Each task is designed to be specific and independently actionable.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1: Setup tasks must be completed before other phases.
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks must be completed before individual User Story phases.
- User Story phases (P1, P2, P3) can be developed in parallel where tasks do not have explicit file dependencies.
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns depends on the completion of all User Story phases.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Within each lesson's content drafting, tasks like adding sections, diagrams, and AI placeholders can be parallelized.
- Setting up different lesson folders and their `index.md` files can be done in parallel for each lesson.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow an incremental delivery approach. The MVP will focus on completing Phase 1 and Phase 2, followed by User Story 1 (Lesson 1) as the initial functional content. Subsequent user stories (lessons) will be integrated iteratively. The final polish and verification will ensure overall quality and deployment readiness.
